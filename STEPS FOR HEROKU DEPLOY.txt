HEROKU PIPELINE
Virtual Machine, where we can run our app, access the app from the outerworld in their local machine, they can access via heroku

Cloud Platform where we can deploy the API like FLASk API
DEPLOY A FLASK API in HEROKU
Create and Open the account in 
   1.HEROKU
   2.github
​
Download and install 
   1.HEROKU CLI (Command Line Interface)
   
   https://cli-assets.heroku.com/heroku-x64.exe
   
   
   2.git
   
   https://git-scm.com/download/win
   
Verify it in the POWERSHELL.
​
​
In ANACONDA prompt we need to create the environment to runour flask 
command is 
  
  "conda create -n <envs_name> python==<version>"  
                                     better to try the version of 3.7 or 3.6
then activate the environment
   
   conda activate <envs_name>
​
In pycharm, create the project using previously used interpreter and then
​
we need select the created conda environment in the INTERPRETER,
​
after the project is created.
​
    Select the Interpreter in Pycharm project.
​
then install the flask library
​
<pip install flask> in the terminal
Basic simple code in the flask using pycharm.
​
​
​
from flask import Flask
​
app=Flask(__name__)
​
@app.route('/',methods=["GET","POST"])
def index():
    return"<h1> This is flask application </h1>"
    # <h1> and </h1> is the header1
​
if __name__ == "__main__" :
    app.run()
​
TO deploy the app in heroku,
we need to create two files in Heroku cloud, to create the Environment in Cloud
    1. requirement.txt (all library)
           command in TERMINAL= pip freeze>requirements.txt
    
    2.gunicorn file
           command in TERMINAL = pip install gunicorn
           
           Able to run the file in hiroku which base is LINUX OS
           
     and again freeze the requirements
         pip freeze>requirements.txt
         
         then gunicorn will appear in the requirement files
         
     3. Create the "Procfile" in the flask
     
      edit the file with notepad or pycharm editor
      
      web: gunicorn code.app
      
      web: gunicorn <file_name>: <Flask_objectName>
      
​
       
    We achieve the requirement to deploy the app in heroku
    
    get the source code via github and to heroku 
    
Heroku will read the Procfile.
​
we need to configure the email and username in the github
​
Open the powershell in the flask file folder
Shift + Right click
​
to config the email ID
​
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
​
To link the file in the GitHub Repo
enter the command in the Terminal 
​
git init
​
and the enter 
​
git add <space><.>
​
and then
​
git commit -m "first commit for the application"
​
and,
​
git branch -M main
​
and,
​
git remote add origin https://github.com/NeutrinoBoom/flask_heroku.git
​
and,
​
git push -u origin main
​
​
NOW THE GITHUB REPO IS CREATED FOR THE CODE.
HEROKU ACCOUNT:
Open the heroku

CLick New--> Create New app.

Give the name of the app

and then In Terminal of pycharm, enter the command

heroku login -i

Enter the credentials of the heroku login

Email ID Password

then copy the link from heroku

heroku git:remote -a flask-heroku-4194
then write,

git push heroku main  
becuase we change the branch name to main <git branch -M main>

​
